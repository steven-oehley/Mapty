# Mapty - Map your workouts
<hr>
Mapty is a web application that allows you to log and visualize your workouts on an interactive map.        
This project is based on Jonas Schmedtmann's course project from **The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!***.

## Features
- Workout Logging: Log your running or cycling workouts with details like distance, duration, and specific metrics (cadence for running, elevation gain for cycling).
- Interactive Map: Utilizes Leaflet.js to display workouts as markers on an interactive map.
- Geolocation: Automatically detects your current location to center the map.
- Form Validation: Ensures that workout input values are valid and positive.
- Data Storage: Saves workout data locally in the browser's localStorage, allowing data persistence between sessions.
- Workout Rendering: Renders logged workouts both on the map as markers and in a sidebar list.
  
## Tech Stack
- HTML5: Structured the web page using semantic HTML5 elements.
- CSS3: Styled the application for a clean and modern user interface.
- JavaScript (ES6+): Used modern JavaScript features including classes, arrow functions, async/await, and more.
- Leaflet.js: Integrated Leaflet library to work with interactive maps.
- Browser Geolocation API: Utilized the Geolocation API to retrieve the user's current location.
- Local Storage: Saved and retrieved workout data using localStorage for persistent data storage.
